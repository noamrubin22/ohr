øhr is a dApp that enables users to create audio NFTs on the spot to capture moments in the form of sound.

the main three use cases of øhr are:

- artistic expression
- encapsulation of memories
- audio POAP (proof of attendance)

we built this dApp for the Grizzlython, a hackathon organised by [Solana](https://solana.com/)

## How it works

You can record sound by holding the recording button. The audio is then transformed into an image and together with a timestamp, (optionally) a location and audio file minted on the Solana blockchain

Minting an NFT provides proof of ownership and authenticity of recording and its visualization.

Each audio NFT is unique and can be bought, sold, or traded. This provides a new way for collectors, music enthusiasts, and anyone interested in unique and rare digital assets to own and share special audio recordings and their visualizations. At the same time, providing an easy way for creators, that are perhaps not so familiar with web3, to mint an NFT. 

To use øhr, you need a compatible web3 wallet that works on the Solana chain and SOL tokens to pay for gas fees.

## Technologies

- React
- @solana/web3.js

## Development

To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
npm i
npm run start
```

The dApp is open-source, and contributions and feedback from the community are welcome. If you are interested in contributing to øhr, please see our GitHub repository for more information. 

Some of our ideas for future implementations:
- enabling users to chain sounds after transferring NFTs
- a map that visualises all the audio NFTs created with øhr
- collabs with generative artists
- betOnChain: bet with your friends, and put it on chain.
- converting it into a native app in React Native

## Legal considerations

It is important to note that copyright and ownership laws can vary by jurisdiction, and it may be necessary to seek legal advice to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. øhr is not responsible for any legal issues that may arise from the use of the dApp.
